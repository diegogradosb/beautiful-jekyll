I am a nomadic [PhD Student](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00090839) spending my investigation time in Peru and Belgium. The motivation of my current research is to develop multi-target methodologies and system modeling approaches for the agro-ecosystems' technical sustainability assessment. I am an open source software user and avid traveller attemping to play the [harmonica](https://allaboutharmonicas.com/review-on-the-hohner-special-20-harmonica). Drone pilot and fervent maker of the world famous [Pisco Sour](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/travel/enjoying-pisco-cocktails-in-lima-peru.html).

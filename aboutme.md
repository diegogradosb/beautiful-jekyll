I was a nomadic [PhD Researcher](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios) spending my investigation time in Peru and Belgium. The motivation of my current research is to develop multi-target methodologies and system modeling approaches for the agroecosystems' technical sustainability assessment. I am an user of open-source software and avid traveller attempting to play the [harmonica](https://allaboutharmonicas.com/review-on-the-hohner-special-20-harmonica) and [piano](https://www.achamilton.co.uk/old/HP3e.htm). ~~Drone pilot and fervent maker of the world famous [Pisco Sour](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/travel/enjoying-pisco-cocktails-in-lima-peru.html)~~.

I am a nomadic Ph.D. Student spending my research time between Peru and Belgium. The motivation of my work is the develop of multi-target methodologies and system modeling approaches for the assessment of agro-ecosystems's technical sustainability analysis. I am an open source software user and avid traveller attemping to play the [harmonica](https://allaboutharmonicas.com/review-on-the-hohner-special-20-harmonica). Fervent lover and maker of the world famous [Pisco Sour](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/travel/enjoying-pisco-cocktails-in-lima-peru.html).

I am a nomadic [Ph.D. Student](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00090839) spending my research time in Peru and Belgium. The motivation of my research is to develop multi-target methodologies and system modeling approaches for the assessment of agro-ecosystems's technical sustainability analysis. I am an open source software user and avid traveller attemping to play the [harmonica](https://allaboutharmonicas.com/review-on-the-hohner-special-20-harmonica). Fervent lover and maker of the world famous [Pisco Sour](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/travel/enjoying-pisco-cocktails-in-lima-peru.html).
